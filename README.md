# FM Server
## A custom server built with Go

This is a simple HTTP server that can handle only GET requests, and serve
static files from a directory.

To serve the contents of a directory, go to that directory, and just type

`fmserver 8080`

Of course, you can change 8080 to any port you want. ** Make sure fmserver is in your PATH before you do this **
